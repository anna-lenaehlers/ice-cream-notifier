# Ice Cream Notifier

- to start this locally just open the index.html in a browser of your choice
- every 10 minutes a request is fired to get the most recent temperature

## What should still be done

- flag should be reset when a new day starts
- time zones
- different metrics in different countries
- storing the data persistently so the tab/window can be closed not losing the context
